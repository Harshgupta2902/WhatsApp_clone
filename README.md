## Fortified by Firebase Firestore üåê

At the heart of WhatsUp is the mighty Firebase Firestore. We rely on Firestore to securely save user data and facilitate seamless message transmission. Each message sent by a user is immediately whisked away to Firestore, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery. Notably, messages sent are promptly removed from Firestore as soon as they are received by the recipient's device, enhancing privacy and security.

## Your Privacy, Our Priority üõ°Ô∏è

In WhatsUp, messages within a chat are stored exclusively on the phones of the communicating individuals. This design ensures that your conversations remain private and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. Your messages are your own, and we're committed to keeping it that way.

## Known Issues

- Sometimes attachments that were received while in the chat page are not playable
- Seen feature not working sometimes
- Performance issues in app camera (especially on Android)
